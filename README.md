# DDLs - Data Defintions
This repository is ONLY put in place to share updates to the various databases we support and the DDLs to seed the database structures and dataloaders to pre-seed the databases with reference data.

DDL files can be located in the /src directory and each supported RDBMS has a sub-directory within it

# Supported RDBMS
Within the src/datatier you will see that we have support for Postgres, MariaDB and SQL Server.
Currently, we have focused on building out the capabilities within SQL Server. There are several free SQL 
Server options.

Here are links to the Free or Open Source RDBMS:
